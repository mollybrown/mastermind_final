MISSION: BREAK THE SECRET CODE

The secret code is made up of four elements: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow. The four elements can appear in any order, up to four times. You have an unlimited number of guesses. Each time you make a guess without cracking code, you will recieve two hints.

One hint will give you the number of correct color elements in your guess. Another hint will give you the number of correctly positioned/ordered color elements in your guess."

For example, if you guess 'RRGY' and the secret code is 'RRRR', then you will recieve feedback telling you that you have one color correct, and two positions correct.

Exit the game at any time by typing 'q' or 'quit'."
	
Be a cheater and reveal the secret code by typing 'c' or 'cheat'.
		
GOOD LUCK!
